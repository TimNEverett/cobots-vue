      <info-sub-section question="How will the raffle work?">
        The raffle will be drawn 24 hours after the last Co-Bot is minted. The
        10 winning Co-Bots will be randomly drawn by our smart contract and
        appear on this site, one winner every minute. The prizes will be
        immediately sent by the contract to the wallets holding the winning
        Co-Bots.

        question="Did someone say BONUS PRIZES?"
      >
        <div>
          Yep! In addition to the 10 main prizes,
          <text class="font-extrabold">
            the community can work together to unlock 20 more prizes of 2.5ETH
            each.
          </text>
          Hereâ€™s how:
        </div>

        <div>
          5,000 Co-Bots will be minted with blue screens and 5,000 will be
          minted with red screens. Once the last Co-Bot is minted, buttons will
          appear on the site that let you change the colour of your bot's screen
          (s/o on-chain art ðŸ’ª).
        </div>

        <div class="font-extrabold">
          If the community coordinates to change at least 9,500 of the Co-Bots'
          screens to the same colour before the raffle draw (24 hours after
          minting out), the bonus prizes will be unlocked! The 20 winners will
          be drawn randomly by the smart contract immediately after the main
          prizes.
        </div>
      </info-sub-section>

      <info-sub-section question="What happens if the Co-Bots don't mint out?">
        Minting will be live for 7 days. If the Co-Bots don't mint out by then,
        holders will be able to claim a full refund (minus gas) on this site.
        You'll have 7 days to claim your refund.
      </info-sub-section>

      <info-sub-section question="How many Co-Bots can I mint?">
        You can mint 20 Co-Bots.
      </info-sub-section>

      <info-sub-section question="What happens after the raffle?">
        <div>
          Our hope is that the Co-Bots will bond over this event and become a
          lasting force in the NFT world!
        </div>
        <div>
          We'd like to do more Co-Bot events, but aren't making any promises
          right now. Please only buy a Co-Bot for the cool pixel art and fun
          community event!
        </div>
      </info-sub-section>

      <info-sub-section question="Can the same wallet win multiple prizes?">
        No. Once a winning Co-Bot has been chosen, the associated wallet will
        not be able to win again.
      </info-sub-section>

      <info-sub-section question="Can the creators win prizes?">
        No. Weâ€™ll be minting 20 Co-Bots for ourselves, but they wonâ€™t be
        eligible to win prizes.
      </info-sub-section>

      <info-sub-section question="What are the royalties on secondary sales?">
        They are none! We want you to trade Co-Bots as freely as possible.
      </info-sub-section>

      <info-sub-section question="Is there a Discord?">
        Thereâ€™s no creator-made Discord for Co-Bots, but weâ€™d love to see the
        community create one! If you do, invite us? ðŸ¥º
      </info-sub-section>

      <info-sub-section question="Why should I trust you?">
        <div>
          Actually, you donâ€™t need to trust us at all. The mint, raffle, and
          refund mechanisms are implemented completely trustlessly in the
          Co-Bots smart contract. That means that the contract will carry out
          those functions automatically, and we couldnâ€™t stop it even if we
          wanted to.
        </div>

        <div>
          We also wonâ€™t be able to withdraw any ETH until one of the following
          conditions is met:
        </div>

        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 pl-2">
          <li>
            The raffle is complete and all the prizes have been sent to the
            winners
          </li>
          <li>
            The Co-Bots didnâ€™t mint out and the 7 day refund period has passed
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div>
          You can view the contract on Etherscan by clicking the Etherscan
          button in the nav bar above.
        </div>
      </info-sub-section>

      <info-sub-section question="Is the art on-chain?">
        Why yes, it is! The art for Co-Bots is generated by code in our smart
        contract. That means it doesn't depend on third party servers to host
        it. As long as Ethereum exists, so will your Co-Bot art!
      </info-sub-section>

      <info-sub-section question="Is Co-Bots CC0?">
        Yep! To the extent possible under law, we have waived all copyright and
        related or neighboring rights to Co-Bots.
